## Explanation:
# Partition	  Size	  Purpose
# nvs	        256KB	  Non-volatile storage (for settings!)
# phy_init	  4KB	    WiFi/BT calibration data
# factory	    2.7MB	    Your application


# After exhaustion: Cells can get "stuck" (always 0 or 1), causing write failures or data corruption. (~100,000 (conservative estimate: 10,000))

# I'm constantly saving the time into flash (to keep it in case of reboot)

# Good news: ESP-IDF's NVS has built-in wear-leveling! It doesn't write to the same flash location every time. It:
#   - Spreads writes across the entire NVS partition
#   - Your NVS partition is 256KB
#   - Flash sector size = 4KB, so ~64 sectors available (so 64x times those 10k-100k writes)
